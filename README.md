An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

For this analysis, the goal was to discover trends amongst Kickstarter campaigns in order to help Louise, a playwrite, with launching her own project. 
Because Louise is launching a play on Kickstarter, my analysis revolves around the success of theater projects particularly. One factor worth looking into was the launch date of a theater campaign. I collected data on this to see if there were any distinct trends that could indicate a better or worse time to launch a project.

When looking at this chart, there is a spike of successful projects that start in June. With this data, I can advise Louise to launch her project in the summertime rather than the winter months. This trend appears in all categories of Kickstarter campaigns, as seen in the chart below.

Another factor that could aid in this analysis was examining the fundraising goals of campaigns. I collected data to see if the amount of money asked for had any effect on the success, failure or cancellation of a project.

One interesting piece about this chart is that there is virtually no data on canceled projects in the theater subcategory. Based on the data collected thus far, theater projects do pretty well on Kickstarter overall. However, with the 'Outcomes Based on Goals' chart in particular, projects with higher goals fail more often than projects with lower goals. With this in mind, it may be better to launch smaller projects that require less money on Kickstarter. Another idea would be getting another source of funding for large campaigns rather than attempting to fund the entire project with Kickstarter alone. 

This analysis led to discovering some great tips for Louise when launching her play. However, a piece of data that could have been helpful for this project would be the advertising side of it. For example, analyzing what compels a person to donate to a campaign or the genre of plays that do better on Kickstarter could have been significant to this analysis.
